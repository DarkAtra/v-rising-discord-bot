## Code Conventions and Housekeeping

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.
They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* We use the [Official Kotlin Code Style](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
  Please refer to the documentation to learn how to properly configure it in your IDE.
  In addition, some rules are enforced via the [.editorconfig](../.editorconfig).
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* Verification tasks, including tests, can be executed by running `mvn clean verify` from the project root.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current `main` branch.
